INTRO_OUTRO=Yes, you're right. If you're a pussy. Generating HTML with real languages has been looked down \
  upon in recent years because of how terrible PHP, JSP (and others languages) are. People claim it's because of \
  <i>"separation of view logic and business logic"</i>, but we're all adults here and we can do that ourselves, thank you very much. \
  Sometimes you need more than if/else and foreach, and you no, you shouldn't <i>"always do that in your controller code"</i>. \
  Your controller code is messy enough as it is, trust me.\
  <br><br>\
  People are polluting their controllers with view-logic, and I for one say it's time we stop. We have to man up and \
  start writing view-code in our views where it belongs! It's not that hard to avoid writing business logic.\
  <br><br> \
  Another (better) reason to ditch logic-less template languages is the lack of type safety. Passing all your parameters \
  as a HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; and just guessing/hoping things will work is just sad.
